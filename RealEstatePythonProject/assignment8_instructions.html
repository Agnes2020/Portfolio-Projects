<h1>Assignment 8</h1>

<p><h1>As Usual , congratulation on the work that you have done in the prvoius work, Kudos :)</h1></p>

<h2>Let's play </h2>

<p> This assignment is simple , </br> 
	since you have everthing designed on paper ,</br>
	what you have to do is to code evrything you wrote and all the tests 
</p>

<p> This is how I am going to grade you ,</br>
	I will first run your tests , if you have all the tests (at least five for each class) ,</br>
	and they are running fine you get 50%
</p>
 
 
<p> Well commenting of your code 20% ,</br>
	what do I mean , by proper commenting ,</br>
	is that at the top of each class you say what the class is doing.
	And at the top of aech method you say what the method is doing</br>
</p>
 
 
<p>	Proper naming of classes and variables 20%</p>
<p>	Well documented read me , what do I mean , </br>
	it should say what you are working on,</br>
	and If there are modules that you used that the user needs to install to be able to run </br>
	your code , you need to mention that. 5%</br>
</p>

<p> Putting the author of the file , </br>
	on the top of that file (eg: author: Ella Ty Karambiizi) ,</br>
	5% if it is both of you , you can but both of your names on the top. Be honest :)</br>
