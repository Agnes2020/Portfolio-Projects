Project Proposal: 
My partner and I will be working on a business project that somehow
 resembles real estate agency, but instead of selling, 
 our program will be about renting properties out to prospective customers. 
 This project will be made interactive such that the backend user 
 and the front end user both will be able to easily
  interact with our code. The backend user needs to log in with his credentials to update,
 delete and add more information about properties while the front end-user needs to be able to
  view available properties and choose which ones he wants to rent. 
  Now, these properties include both lands and houses making it as vast as possible.
